# Ludum Dare 42 Entry: "Don't Let 'em Fall!" by Jonasz KÄ…dziela

## A few words of introduction:
A game made for Ludum Dare 42 competition in 72 hours. I decided to create a quite simple game, that would enable me to tinker a bit with things I've never done before (like Nav Mesh, Map Generation) ðŸ˜€

## How to play?
* The map consists of 400 cubes (20x20)
* During 180 seconds the map is being gradually destroyed
* The game becomes a bit harder every 5 seconds
* You have to save as many units as possible

## Controls:

### Basic Controls
* **Left Mouse Button** - select units
* **Left Mouse Button** + **Drag** - box selection
* **Right Mouse Button** - set destination point for selected units

### Camera Movement
* **W** or **Up Arrow** - move camera forward
* **S** or **Down Arrow** - move camera backward
* **A** or **Left Arrow** - move camera to the left
* **D** or **Right Arrow** - move camera to the right
* **MouseWheel** - zoom in/zoom out

### Other Controls
* **Hold Left CTRL** - group selection mode
* **ESC** or **P** - pause the game
* **H** - show/hide score UI

**I do really hope that the game isn't too hard or straight up boring. I had very little time to play and balance it** ðŸ˜…
